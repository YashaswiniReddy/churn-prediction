# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the service) using supervised machine learning. By identifying high-risk customers in advance, telecom companies can take proactive steps to retain them.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a significant concern in the telecom industry. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses historical customer data to build a predictive model that identifies churn patterns based on customer demographics, services, and account details.

## 🔍 Top 5 Drivers of Churn

Based on feature importance from Random Forest:

1. **Contract Type** – Month-to-month customers churn more than those on yearly contracts  
2. **Tenure Months** – Customers with shorter tenure churn more  
3. **Monthly Charges** – High bills are linked to higher churn  
4. **Online Security** – Lack of security service is a churn risk  
5. **Tech Support** – Customers without support tend to leave more
